Here's an updated `README.md` that reflects the fact that users do not need to add an additional button, as the script includes a floating button:

# Maya Widget

The Maya Widget is a customizable modal widget that you can easily integrate into your website by adding a single script. It provides a sleek, responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

## Demo

Check out a live demo of the Maya Widget [here](https://vin-jex.github.io/maya-script/).

## Features

- Simple integration with a single script
- Responsive and modern design
- Customizable content and styles
- Interactive modal with a floating action button

## Installation

To integrate the Maya Widget into your website, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Include the Script

Add the following script tag to the `<body>` section of your HTML file:

```html
  <script src="https://vin-jex.github.io/maya-script/maya.js"></script>
```

### Full Example

Hereâ€™s a complete example of how your HTML might look:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Example Website</title>
</head>

<body>

  <!-- Include the Widget Script -->
  <script src="https://vin-jex.github.io/maya-script/maya.js"></script>

</body>

</html>
```

## Customization

You can customize the Maya Widget by modifying the CSS and HTML within the `maya.js` script. Here are a few examples:

### Change Background Color

To change the background color of the modal, you can modify the CSS in the script:

```css
.modal-content {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```

### Update Content

To update the content of the modal, such as the text or images, modify the corresponding HTML within the script:

```html
<div class="modal-messages">
  <div class="message message-left">
    <img src="your-image-url.jpg" alt="Maya" class="message-img">
    <p class="message-text">Your custom message here.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Troubleshooting

If the widget is not working as expected, consider the following steps:

1. **Check Network Requests:**
   - Open your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect").
   - Go to the "Network" tab and reload the page.
   - Ensure that the script is being loaded successfully.

2. **Console Errors:**
   - Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors.
   - Make sure there are no syntax errors in your `maya.js` file.

3. **Resource Loading:**
   - Ensure that any external resources (images, fonts, etc.) are accessible and correctly linked.
